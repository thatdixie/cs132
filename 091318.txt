bit-smallest unit of data
byte-smallest unit of storage

-file mode-

file
 command is useful for determining the type of the file

df
 command reports status of mounted file system(organized collection of units available for data connected to the single file hierarchy rooted at '/')and provides an easy way to check the amount of free space and capacity of all storage available on the UNIX system
 list 6 fields
  -name
  -capacity
  -used
  -available
  -percent of use
  -pathname
 mount point is the directory on which the file system is attached, on windows seperate disks are named like C: E: etc
