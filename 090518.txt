Everything is a file! Simplifies the OS making it easy to maintain and extend

UNIX file system hierarchy with root("/") at the top

directories end with "/"
shortcuts or symlinks end with "@"

sub directories that exist on all systems underneath root:
bin
etc
home
usr
dev
lib

/bin- originally stored all programs/commands/executable files/binaries
bin is short for binaries
/etc- created to store configuration files and miscellaneous stuff
/dev- makes unix special and each file represents a physical or logical device
/usr- contains executables
/var- administrative files
/lib- library files
/tmp- temporary files
/boot- contains startup files for operating system, kernels to be loaded
/home-
/proc-

absolute pathname-starts with a forward slash and always begins with root
relative pathname-starts with current or present working directory(PWD)- relative to where you are

directory or 'folder' is a file with the structure of a table
-each row represents a file called a directory entry composed of the name of the file and an index number for disc location

hidden files begin with a dot(".") and contain configurations which is why the command ls ignores such files and therefore they are hidden to prevent unintentional modification

./ current directory
../ previous directory

tab in bash will file out the name of directory if it exists for you
